# SAMPLE Compiler Frontend for Class Assignment

Lexical analyzer, syntax analyzer and semantic analyzer for the SAMPLE language, which is given [here](https://github.com/zhaozihanzzh/SampleCompilerFrontendExperiment/blob/main/SAMPLE_Definition.doc), using flex and bison.

The code is intended for Windows. 

## Compilation:

1) Install mingw.

2. Download or clone the repo, unzip win_flex_bison-2.5.20.zip and add the directory into PATH environment variables.
3. Execute mingw32-make and run it.

Notice: the code is kind of simple and may need to be rewritten for long-term maintenance.
